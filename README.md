# NASA-Space-App-Challenge
Aeris Disease Checker is crowd-source solution to the Air Check challenge. The solution would collect the data from the open source datasets available at NASA GIBS API and Google maps. The data would also be collected via form based questionnaire, which would help to map the disease pattern and it intensity in that geographic location. The location of the respondent collected from forms would be geo-coded and then imported to the Google products (e.g. GoogleEarth, Google Maps) for the mapping of the disease. It would assist policy-makers and researchers to make a comparison and get in-depth analysis based upon this real time data input of different environment factors along with the frequency of the diseases related to the climatic parameters (Ozone, nitrous oxide, CO, wind speed, temperature, humidity, Dust Score, aerosol optical depth, precipitation estimate etc.) of the area associated with the disease so that the effective measures would be taken to curtail the disease and manage the climate in a way to help the living easy and possible on this ever changing planet.
